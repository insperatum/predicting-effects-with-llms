The number of people who say that acts of terrorism against Americans are imminent is up 3% from last year, according to a new poll released this week. In the wake of attacks in San Bernardino, Orlando, Paris, and London, the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans think major terrorist attacks are likely to occur soon on American soil. Government officials have echoed these concerns. “We are issuing a new advisory that the terror threat is now elevated across the country,” said Undersecretary for Homeland Security Stephen Krause. “We have to remain vigilant and we have to stay alert.

As can be seen, around 90 Americans are killed each year by terrorism on U.S. soil. This means the risk of being a victim of terrorism in a given year is about 1 in 3.5 million. In comparison, the risk of being killed by cancer is 1 in 540, the risk of being killed in a car accident is 1 in 8,000, and the chance of being killed by your own home appliances is 1 in 1.5 million. These numbers provide some essential context when thinking about the different threats to our public safety.

In this role, she was the primary contact between vendors and staff and oversaw project costs and schedule.

Highland keeps monthly performance data (e.g., budget and schedule variance, stakeholder acceptance and feedback) and conducts quarterly performance reviews for all employees. In looking at the data, Ms. Morgan consistently performed in the top 20% of employees in similar positions. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

New Federal Gun Regulations Raise Constitutional Concerns
 (AP - 7/1/16) Congress is considering federal legislation that would require background checks for all gun buyers, including those who purchase from private sellers, currently exempt from such regulations. The proposed legislation would also limit the sale and manufacture of ammunition in automatic magazines to ten rounds. A recent public opinion poll indicates “over 85%” of Americans support federal legislation addressing gun violence in these specific respects.

Gun rights advocates say that the proposed legislation is a violation of their Second Amendment rights.  They also argue that the federal law infringes on States’ police powers to regulate for the health, safety and morals of local citizens. James Lott, a representative from the National Rifle Association says, “this is just another example of Congress trying to impose its will on the citizens of the several states.” Matthew Lorne, a gun control advocate is quick to point out, “the bill only fills loopholes in current laws and bans extremely dangerous weapons.  No sportsman needs more than ten rounds to kill a deer.”

Legal experts overwhelmingly agree that Congress has the constitutional authority to enact such legislation in our federal system. “The Supreme Court would surely uphold this statute,” said Robert Farber, a constitutional law scholar at George Washington University.  “Article I gives Congress broad discretion to regulate goods shipped through interstate commerce, including firearms. It is true that most gun safety regulations are passed as a matter of state authority under the Tenth Amendment, but this law does not represent an impermissible intrusion on state police powers.”

New Federal Law Regarding Tuition Benefits Raises Constitutional Concerns
(AP – 7/1/16) Federal lawmakers may make it significantly harder for undocumented college students to get the same tuition benefits as classmates they have grown up with.  Congress is considering a bill providing that no school that receives federal funding may allow undocumented students to receive in-state tuition benefits; any school that makes this sort of allowance will immediately lose all federal money that they receive. 

Schools use federal dollars for everything from building research facilities to funding student scholarships.  “This is a hit that no state university can afford to take,” said Matthew Lorne, president of Irving State University in Rhode Island. “It effectively forces state schools to punish undocumented students, and there is nothing we can do about it.” James Lott, the Congressman from Virginia who is sponsoring the bill, was quick to point out, “the law does not prevent anyone from attending college, it just requires undocumented students to pay the same as out of state students.  It stops those here illegally from getting the special treatment rightfully reserved for legal state residents.”

Currently it is up to each state to decide whether undocumented students can receive in-state tuition.  Eighteen states allow such benefits for undocumented students, while three states specifically prohibit undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition.  A recent public opinion poll indicates that “over 85%” of Americans support congressional action that restricts tuition benefits to undocumented students as a matter of national policy.

Legal experts overwhelmingly agree that Congress has the constitutional authority to enact such legislation in our federal system.  “The Supreme Court would surely uphold this statute,” said Robert Farber, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University. “Article I gives Congress broad discretion in saying how federal funds should be spent and making laws pertaining to immigration.  States are independent entities under the Tenth Amendment, but this is not an unfair intrusion on each state’s ability to decide how to allocate their own tuition benefits.”

New Federal Law Regarding Tuition Benefits Raises Constitutional Concerns
(AP – 7/1/16) Federal lawmakers may make it significantly harder for undocumented college students to get the same tuition benefits as classmates they have grown up with.  Congress is considering a bill providing that no school that receives federal funding may allow undocumented students to receive in-state tuition benefits; any school that makes this sort of allowance will immediately lose all federal money that they receive. 

Schools use federal dollars for everything from building research facilities to funding student scholarships.  “This is a hit that no state university can afford to take,” said Matthew Lorne, president of Irving State University in Rhode Island. “It effectively forces state schools to punish undocumented students, and there is nothing we can do about it.” James Lott, the Congressman from Virginia who is sponsoring the bill, was quick to point out, “the law does not prevent anyone from attending college, it just requires undocumented students to pay the same as out of state students.  It stops those here illegally from getting the special treatment rightfully reserved for legal state residents.”

Currently it is up to each state to decide whether undocumented students can receive in-state tuition.  Eighteen states allow such benefits for undocumented students, while three states specifically prohibit undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition.  A recent public opinion poll indicates that “over 85%” of Americans support congressional action that restricts tuition benefits to undocumented students as a matter of national policy.

Legal experts overwhelmingly agree that Congress does not have the constitutional authority to enact such legislation in our federal system.  “The Supreme Court would surely strike down this statute,” said Robert Farber, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University. “Article I gives Congress broad discretion in saying how federal funds should be spent and making laws pertaining to immigration, but states are independent entities under the Tenth Amendment. This is clearly an unfair intrusion on each state’s ability to decide how to allocate their own tuition benefits.”",,0,0,

A Big Year For Both Democratic and Republican Women in the 2020 Elections

 The 2020 elections saw a surge of Democratic and Republican women who ran for offices at all levels, whether in Washington, state capitols, or city halls. Across the country, many of these women candidates ran to bring new voices to politics. For example, Charlene Washington, a newly-elected member of the House of Representatives in Georgia, ran TV ads in which her tagline was “As a woman, I will bring a fresh perspective to Washington.” Amy Johnson, who won a House race in Michigan, said in her acceptance speech that “Women like me will get to work and make a difference for our communities and the rest of the nation.” 2020 was a banner year for women candidates of both parties. Maria Gonzalez, a scholar who has written extensively about American politics notes that “this is a new era for women in government. Over the last few years, we have seen historic numbers of women running for office—and winning.”

While official employment rates have improved in recent years, analysts report that the U.S. economy remains unstable. Though the economic recovery means that many Americans are back at work, a variety of indicators offer alarming forecasts for the future prospects of middle and working class Americans.

Recent reports have highlighted a number of jarring facts: More than half of Americans aged 18-34 have little or no savings. Most members of this age group cannot afford to buy homes, a fact that threatens the stability of the housing market. Further, record levels of student debt mean many of these individuals must spend a significant portion of their income on debt payments. 

At the same time, Americans are retiring in large numbers. Record numbers of retirees in the coming years will place a great and potentially unsustainable strain on programs like Social Security and Medicare. These programs, which many older Americans depend on, will face serious budgetary pressures as this generation moves from paying in to the system to drawing out. 

Official unemployment statistics seem promising, but do not count the number of people who can only find part-time jobs or who have given up on looking for work altogether. Working class Americans continue to struggle to find jobs with wages and benefits sufficient to support their families. The middle class is not doing much better, as a college degree offers less of an advantage in the labor market than it did in the past. As a result, millions are at risk of foreclosure. We are now eight years out from the recession of 2008 and fiscal analysts warn that it may soon be time for the stock market to undergo another major correction. Many are concerned that such a downturn could lead to a new recession.

Recently, there has been a great deal of discussion about the demographic make-up of the country, how it has changed in recent years and how it may change in the future. As political analysts discuss trends in the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S., it's important for them to know the results of cutting edge research. In some cases, demographic research agrees with what most analysts have been saying, but there are also some important differences between the data and the discussions we see in the media.  Below is a graph of the proportions of Americans who fall into different racial and ethnic categories. The left side of the graph gives recent census results. The dashed lines on the right give projections from recent demographic models of American population change (University of Virginia Population Study Center, 2012).

Between 1960 and 2010, the proportion of white Americans fell from about 85% of the total U.S. population to about 63%.  In contrast, the share of the population consisting of members of other racial or ethnic groups has risen steadily from 1960 to 2010, and this rise is projected to continue in the future.  Research suggests that white Americans will consist of less than 50% of the total population by about 2040, and fall to about 42% of the population by 2060. The data show that the proportion of Americans who are white has declined, and will continue to decline in coming years. The majority of Americans will be nonwhite in about 25 years.

New U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that the rate of geographical mobility, or the number of individuals who have moved within the past year, has remained stable over the past several years. According to the new data, 35.7 million people changed residences between 2013 and 2014. This mover rate of 11.5 percent is consistent with recent mover rates, which have ranged between 11.5 and 12.5 percent. Recent annual mover rates reflect a slight decrease from an uptick to 12.5 percent between 2008 and 2009.

Of the 35.7 million people who changed residences between 2013 and 2014, the majority remained within the same state. Of those who moved from one region of the United States to another, the largest group appears to have moved to the South. As in previous years, the 2013-2014 period saw a pattern of migration from the city to suburbs: principal cities lost approximately 1.7 million residents, while suburbs gained about 2.2 million. Renters remained more mobile than homeowners.

Additional data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey suggest that the mover rate for young adults remained above the national average during this period. Young adults – particularly those between 18 to 24 years of age – remained highly mobile, relative to the population at large. Young adult females exhibited the highest mover rate of all.

Although the 12-percent average mover rate of the past several years is below the 20.2 percent rate in 1948, the first year the Census Bureau collected such data, the stability of the current rate suggests this rate is normal for the kind of economy it reflects.",,0,0,"has pictures for condition 2, but the study can be run without"
Craig735,Racial Majority & Minority Group Members' Psychological and Political Reactions to Minority Population Growth,XTESS222,1,Hispanic Growth,"The Hispanic American Population is Surging

New U.S. Census Bureau data reveal that Hispanic Americans have emerged as the fastest growing of the three major ethnic minority populations (Asians, Hispanics, and Blacks) in the United States. According to Census Bureau data, the Hispanic American population is increasing four times faster than the total U.S. population. This trend is also reflected on a state-by-state basis; in almost all states, the Hispanic American population is growing by 30 percent or more. In the next forty years, the Hispanic American population is expected to more than double whereas the White population is expected to shrink by about 20 million people. The primary reasons for this accelerating demographic change are rapid growth in Hispanic immigration to the US as well as rising birthrates among US-born Hispanic Americans. “A greater Hispanic presence is now evident in all parts of the country – in large and small metropolitan areas, in the Snowbelt and in the Sunbelt,” said Mark Gray, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed the Census Bureau data, “From now on, local, state, and national politicians will need to pay attention to Hispanics.”

Craig735,Racial Majority & Minority Group Members' Psychological and Political Reactions to Minority Population Growth,XTESS222,3,Control,"U.S. Census Bureau Reports National Mover Rate Increases After a Record Low

New U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that the rate of geographical mobility, or the number of individuals who have moved within the past year, is increasing. The national mover rate increased from a record low of 11.6 percent (the lowest rate since the U.S. Census Bureau began tracking the data) in 2011 to 12.0 percent in 2012. According to the new data, about 36.5 million people changed residences in the U.S. within the past year. A majority (64.4%) of all movers stayed within the same county. Renters were more than five times more likely to move than homeowners. The estimates also reveal that many of the nation’s fastest-growing communities are suburbs. For example, suburbs had 17.9 million move in and 9.2 million move out — an increase of 8.7 million movers. For those who moved to a different county or state, the reasons for moving varied considerably by the length of their move (e.g., family-related, job-related). “A greater amount of geographic mobility is now evident in all parts of the country – in large and small metropolitan areas, in the Snowbelt and in the Sunbelt,” said Mark Gray, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed the Census Bureau data, “From now on, local, state, and national politicians will need to pay attention to their residents’ mobility.”

Commentary. George Anderson, a representative from the Trump campaign pointed out the importance of the KnowPolitics poll: ""This poll is more evidence that Trump is increasing his support at the national level,"" and he also dismissed the poll by Public-Metrics as biased. Anderson said that Clinton is trying to boost her performance by reporting results from poorly conducted polls like this one, and pointed out that some of these polls showing a Clinton lead, including this one by Public-Metrics, might have been funded by her campaign. We could not reach a representative from the Clinton campaign for comment by the time this story was published.",Now you will be provided with an online news story that reports the results of two recent election polls.

Washington. Recent polls have started to focus on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's electoral support at the national level as they are the two most likely candidates to compete in the general election. One poll by KnowPolitics suggests that Clinton is ahead of Trump, but another poll by Public-Metrics shows higher support for Trump than Clinton.
Clinton's ahead. In a poll conducted by KnowPolitics this week, 48% of respondents said they would vote for Clinton compared to only 42% for Trump, with the rest of respondents undecided. The margin of error for this result is ±2%. The poll was conducted on a nationally representative sample of likely voters with a response rate of 19%. The final sample size was 1703 adults, with 669 Republicans, 738 Democrats, and 296 Independents.

Commentary. George Anderson, a polling expert affiliated with the National Council on Public Polls, cautioned against making conclusive judgments by relying on the results of these polls. Anderson said that it is too early to predict who would win the election: ""Such polls are just not reliable enough in this early stage of the campaign to figure out who is going to win an election this close,"" and pointed out the recent failures of polls predicting election results in Canada and the UK.",Now you will be provided with an online news story that reports the results of two recent election polls.

“My name is Michelle Johnson, and my son Keith has schizophrenia.  Keith was a star student and athlete all through high school.  After he graduated from college, Keith got a good job managing a restaurant in our city.  Then, a year later, everything changed: Keith was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  In a matter of months, he lost his job and his apartment.  Sometimes he stayed at home with us, but often we couldn’t find him.  Keith’s father and I were so scared.  We didn’t know what was happening to our son or how to help him.  Finally, we took Keith to the emergency room.  The doctors there recommended inpatient treatment and tried to find Keith a bed at one of the city’s mental health facilities, but none were immediately available.  While we searched for an opening in inpatient treatment, Keith saw a local psychiatrist once a week and received home visits from the city’s intensive treatment team, which helps people with serious mental illness get the care they need and also assists with housing and employment.  After more than a month, we found Keith a spot in an inpatient program.  Once he started the program, Keith did well.  He began taking medication regularly and participating in therapy.  After two weeks, he was discharged to continue treatment in the community and came to live with us.  

That was three years ago.  Today, Keith continues to take medication, see his doctor regularly, and receive visits from the intensive treatment team.  He has his own apartment, which the intensive treatment team helped him find, and a full-time job at a local business, which he found with help from the city’s supported employment program.  I am so grateful that we were able to get Keith the treatment he needed, but we are unfortunately now badly in debt.  Our insurance covered only a small part of Keith’s treatment costs.  We have used up almost all our savings and still struggle to pay the medical bills.”

Michelle Johnson spoke these words on a radio program four months ago.  Keith’s untreated schizophrenia went on to have terrible consequences: it led him to commit last week’s shooting in Oliver Park.  Witnesses say Keith arrived at the park around 12:30pm and appeared agitated, pacing up and down and talking to himself.  At approximately 12:35pm, Keith took a gun out of his bag and began to shoot.  A father and his two teenage daughters, who were eating lunch in the park, were shot and killed before Keith was tackled by a security guard from a nearby building.  According to a friend who Keith stayed with in the days prior to the shooting, Keith had begun to believe that strangers on the street were government agents with plans to harm him.  Keith Johnson is now in a secure psychiatric facility awaiting trial.

For that reason, the American Cancer Society provides recommendations to the public based on all available evidence about how we as individuals can take action to reduce our cancer risk. One important part of this is how the foods we eat affect our chances of getting cancer, including how much red meat we eat (red meat includes all types of beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat). The American Cancer Society concludes that diets high in red meat probably increase our risk for cancer, so they currently recommend that people should eat less than 12-18 ounces of red meat per week. This means no more than three portions of 4-6 cooked ounces of red meat per week (or about the same size as 1-2 decks of cards). 
 However, new research from Harvard University published this year found no link between high red meat intake and greater cancer risk. In a comment on the findings, both the American Cancer Society and the Harvard team agreed that the majority of evidence on red meat and cancer is mixed and that more convincing research is needed before changing the existing American Cancer Society recommendation.",Imagine you came across the following news article while browsing the internet.,0,0,

Questions Raised About Economic, Cultural Impact of Immigrants 

NEW YORK (AP) - During the 1990s, more immigrants entered the United States than in any previous decade, and the growing number of immigrants in the U.S. clearly has some Americans worried. At a state governors’ convention in June, many governors called for the Bush Administration and Congress to step in to restrict the flow of immigrants. 
Several governors voiced concern that immigrants are driving down the wages of American workers while taxpayers are forced to meet the rising costs of social services for the newcomers. Governors say these views are shared by many of their constituents. 
John Baine, shift manager at a large auto parts factors in Cleveland, said he is angered that “a number of friends have been laid-off or forced to take a pay cut” because of the influx of cheap immigrant labor. 
Nancy Petrey, a Boulder, Colo. nurse, has seen staff let go for similar reasons. “People give twenty years of their lives to this hospital and then, boom, they’re out the door because some foreigner will do their job for half the pay,” Petrey said. “It just isn’t right.”
Governors also say constituents are worried that the country is no longer a “melting pot,” because new immigrants are not adopting American values or blending into their new social world. 
Mary Stowe, an Omaha-based sales associate, says she is frustrated by the fact that recent immigrants to her area “do not learn English or make any effort to fit in.” 
Bob Callaway, a construction supervisor in Newark, says he sees similar problems with immigrants hired by his company. “These people are totally unwilling to adopt American values like hard work and responsibility,” Callaway said. “I try not to complain, but sometimes they are so pushy and uncooperative – it’s not acceptable.” 
When asked his opinion, [Nikolai Vandisnky]/[Jose Sanchez], a recent immigrant from [Russia]/[Mexico], says he welcomes the chance for a better life in America. “Many of my cousins find work here and now it’s my turn. I want a good job and benefits.” 
“But,” [Vandinsky]/[Sanchez] added, “that doesn’t mean I have to change who I am. We love our culture. I’m proud to be from [Russia]/[Mexico].” 
While there was agreement at the convention that the federal government needs to do more to help states manage the rising tide of newcomers, few governors agree on exactly why immigration levels have increased. 
Some blame the Immigration Act passed by Congress in 1990, which loosened federal restrictions on immigration. Others point to the fact that large companies are attracting immigrants to the U.S. with the promise of prosperity, a practice that has become widespread in recent years. 
Still others maintain that, in a world full of turmoil, people are attracted here by the hope of a better way of life. 
Whatever is bringing immigrants to these shores in record numbers, everyone seems certain that the numbers will continue to grow.",,,,

Promise Seen in Economic, Cultural Contribution of Immigrants 

NEW YORK (AP) – During the 1990s, more immigrants entered the United States than in any previous decade, and the growing number of immigrants in the U.S. clearly has some Americans hopeful about the future. At a state governors’ convention in June, many governors called for the Bush Administration and Congress to protect the flow of immigrants from further restrictions. 
Several governors said they are encouraged by how immigrants are helping to strengthen the economy, while also providing a welcome boost to tax revenues. Governors say these views are shared by many of their constituents. 
John Baine, shift manager at a large auto parts factory in Cleveland, says he is enthusiastic about how much the influx of immigrant labor has “helped the company keep a lid on costs and remain competitive.” 
Nancy Petrey, a Boulder, Colo. nurse, has seen similar benefits for the hospital where she works. “These people take jobs that are often hard for us to fill, and they’re willing to work shifts that other people don’t want,” Petrey said. “It’s a big help.” 
Governors also say many constituents take pride in the fact that the country is still a “melting pot,” where immigrants continue to bring new experiences and ideas that enrich American culture. 
Mary Stowe, an Omaha-based sales associate, says she admires what it must take to “leave home and come to a place that is so different, without knowing the language or anything about the way of life here.” 
Bob Callaway, a construction supervisor in Newark, says he sees similar qualities in the immigrants hired by his company. “These people are determined and persistent, ” Callaway said. “I’ve gotta give ’em credit, they’ll do what it takes to get ahead. That’s something I respect.”

The data show a declining number of White adults and growing under-18 populations of Hispanics, Asians, and other minorities. Demographers calculate that by 2042, Americans who identify themselves as Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander will together outnumber non-Hispanic Whites. The main reasons for the accelerating change are rapid immigration growth and significantly higher birthrates among racial and ethnic minorities. As White baby boomers age past their childbearing years, younger Hispanic parents are having children and driving U.S. population growth. For example, there are now roughly 9 births for every 1 death among Hispanics, compared to a roughly one-to-one ratio for Whites.

parmerS15,,Z,0,1 [experimental group 1],"Several cases of smallpox were recently confirmed in your community. As one of several government entities responsible for detecting and managing a bioterrorist attack, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) takes this responsibility very seriously and acts carefully and compassionately to protect the public in the event of a laboratory confirmed case of smallpox. Officials are investigating these cases as an act of terrorism and health officials are dedicated to quickly finding, vaccinating, and treating people who may have been exposed to the smallpox virus.  

The Department of Homeland Security is committed to an open and honest process of decision making that guarantees timely, consistent, and accurate information during a biological terrorist attack.  The smallpox vaccine is the best way to defend yourself if you are exposed to the smallpox virus. Vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people.  If you had a smallpox vaccine as a child it will not protect you now, as the vaccine only provides high protection for about 5 years. Anyone directly exposed to smallpox, regardless of health status, will be offered the smallpox vaccine because the risks associated with smallpox disease are far greater than those posed by the vaccine.  The Department of Homeland Security is collaborating with the County Health Department to assign local health workers to your community who are responsible for getting accurate information out to your neighborhood.  These local health workers are recommending vaccinations as the best way to care for you and your neighbors. 
","Thanks to the success of vaccination, the last natural outbreak of smallpox in the U.S. occurred in 1949. In 1980, smallpox was said to be wiped out worldwide, and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since. Today, the smallpox virus is kept in two approved labs in the U.S. and Russia. However, credible concern exists that the virus was made into a weapon by some countries and that terrorists may have obtained it. A single case of smallpox is likely to represent a bioterrorism release and will require an immediate and coordinated public health, medical, and law enforcement response to control the outbreak and to protect the public from any additional release.  The information below describes a fictional smallpox outbreak designed to mimic the events and public health decisions that might occur during an actual bioterrorist attack scenario.",,,

Officials are investigating these cases as an act of terrorism and health officials are using their expertise to quickly find, vaccinate, and treat people who may have been exposed to the smallpox virus. Finding of people who have been exposed, vaccinating, and treating them and their contacts is a proven method for stopping the spread of smallpox. As one of several government entities responsible for detecting and managing a bioterrorist attack, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) response to the current smallpox outbreak builds on concepts and approaches that were successfully employed 30 to 40 years ago to control smallpox outbreaks. These overall concepts for outbreak containment contributed greatly to the eventual global eradication of smallpox. In addition, lessons learned from recent public health crises, such as the emergence of SARS in 2003 have been incorporated into the response to the current smallpox outbreak. 

Overtime, the Department of Homeland Security has learned that the smallpox vaccine is the best protection you can get if you are exposed to the smallpox virus. Vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people.

Republicans Propose Panel to Limit Government Spending on Health Care
        By BRIAN STELTER 
                
        In an effort to limit federal spending on health care, Republicans propose to create an independent commission with the power to ensure that Medicare only pays for procedures with demonstrated medical value. The commission, called the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), would consist of 15 appointed members. Democrats oppose the proposed commission, saying that cuts to Medicare would limit patients’ access to procedures that they and their physician select. 
                Supporters of the plan cite recent reports showing U.S. healthcare costs increased to 16.9 percent of GDP in 2008 and are expected to increase at a rate two times higher than the current rate of inflation. “Anyone who is worried about the federal budget should focus on healthcare costs,” said Bill Strauss, a Republican Representative who supports the plan. “Establishing an independent commission to contain Medicare’s growth to more reasonable rates will significantly lower the amount that the federal government spends on healthcare.” 
                Opponents, however, cite concerns over turning decisions about what constitutes quality care over to a governmental commission. “This plan is giving the government too much power to make decisions that should be left to the individual,” said Representative Andrew Lawrence, a Democratic a vocal opponent of the plan. “We should be putting American consumers back in charge of their choices about healthcare coverage and care, not giving government bureaucrats more power over these decisions.”
         Further debate about the creation of the commission is expected to continue in the coming weeks.

We are going to ask a series of questions about your attitudes. Please answer the following questions about your attitudes about politics by selecting the appropriate option. Please try not to let irrelevant factors influence your responses or bias your judgments.
